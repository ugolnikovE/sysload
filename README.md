# sysload - Lightweight Linux system resource monitor (C library)

'sysload' is a small, dependency-free C library that provides access to basic Linux system metrics - CPU usage, memory and swap stats, storage usage, and uptime - by parsing '/proc' and system calls.

Perfect for lightweight tools, embedded systems, or as an educational example of '/proc' parsing.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- CPU usage calculation via '/proc/stat'
- Memory and swap information from '/proc/meminfo'
- Filesystem statistics via 'statvfs()'
- System uptime and idle time from '/proc/uptime'
- Simple API, no dependencies
- Works on any modern Linux system
- Optional logging via user-provided callbaack

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ugolnikovE/sysload.git
cd sysload
make all        # Build static and shared library + example
sudo make install
```
After installation, the library and header will be available in your system (typically /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include/sysload).

## üíª Example usage
Below is a minimal example showing how to use sysload in your own project after installing the library.
```C
#include "sysload.h"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <inttypes.h>

int main(void)
{
        sl_cpu_usage_t cpu;
        if (sl_cpu_get_usage(1.0f, &cpu) == 0)
                printf("CPU total usage: %.2f%%\n", cpu.total);

        sl_mem_info_t mem;
        if (sl_mem_get_info(&mem) == 0)
        printf("Memory used: %.2f%%\n", mem.percent_used);

        sl_storage_info_t disk;
        if (sl_storage_get_info("/", &disk) == 0)
                printf("Disk used: %.2f%%\n", disk.percent_usage);

        sl_systime_info_t sys;
        if (sl_systime_get_info(&sys) == 0)
                printf("Uptime: %.0lf seconds\n", sys.uptime);

        return 0;
}
```
Compile and Run:
```bash
gcc main.c -o main -lsysload
./main
```
